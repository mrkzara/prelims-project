          <p>The school opened in June 2000 with 19 selected students out of the 72 students who took the examination and with the founders as the first teachers together with Mrs. Miriam Simera-Ramos as a part-time mathematics teacher. During the school year, 2012-2013, all the classrooms were fully air-conditioned. The main campus now houses only the high school and the college departments after the complete transfer of the graders.
            In fact, the school is committed to preparing all of its students to reach new heightsâ€”to climb mountains and kiss the clouds.</p>
          <p> At BCAS, we aim to train and educate young minds to be leaders of excellence. 
            We strive to mold character so our students and graduates become productive members of the local community and the world at large. We cultivate a close-knit learning environment, encouraging our students and staff to treat one another with respect and to care for each other as family. We push the limits of academic excellence and competitiveness, while fostering a fun-filled, enriched educational atmosphere. We would love the opportunity to be your educational needs provider. We hope you consider BCAS and encourage you to make arrangements with our Admissions Office to learn more about the school in person. We look forward to welcoming you to the BCAS family!</p><br><br>

      <h2 class="heading"><span>Our </span> Mission</h2>
      <p class="text">A holistic approach to education aims to develop the total person, encompassing physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and social dimensions.
        By nurturing each of these areas, individuals become fully prepared to meet the challenges of life and contribute to the attainment of national development goals.
        The integration of these five elements results in a well-rounded individual who is equipped with not only academic knowledge but also life skills, personal values, and social responsibility. This approach recognizes the importance of developing individuals who can positively impact society by being socially responsible, culturally sensitive, and morally upright. As such, a center for holistic education seeks to produce individuals who can lead successful and fulfilling lives while contributing to the betterment of society.
